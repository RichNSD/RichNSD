### 🚀 Welcome to My GitHub!

Hey there! I'm Richard, an automation enthusiast and web tinkerer who enjoys scripting my way out of repetitive tasks. I specialize in **PowerShell** and **Bash**, with side quests in **Python** and **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for web-based projects.

### 🔧 What I Do
- **Automation & Scripting** – Because computers should do the boring stuff.
- **Web Development** – Occasionally making the internet a better (or at least weirder) place.
- **Problem-Solving** – Finding creative ways to turn “it’s impossible” into “done.”

### 📌 Current Goals
- Expanding my portfolio with more **automation projects**.
- Diving deeper into **cloud automation** and DevOps practices.
- Refining my **web development skills** with modern frameworks.
