## About Me

I'm an IT engineer from Newton, NJ, who can't decide whether to conquer the world of tech or just fix it when it breaks. 🌍💻 

By day, I delve into the mysteries of support, system admin, and cybersecurity; by night, I transform into a coding ninja, trying not to get beaten up by my own code.

- 🛠️ **What I do:** IT Support, Systems Admin, Cybersecurity, and I occasionally rescue kittens from digital trees.
- 🌱 **Currently Learning:** Full-stack web development, UX enhancement, and how not to hate VIM (even though I won't use it).
- 📫 **How to reach me:** [rjoubert@nsd.team](mailto:rjoubert@nsd.team)
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** The most efficient file backup system I've ever scripted was done using Notepad and ROBOCOPY, a utility that's almost 30 years old, and it probably still functions after 10 years without maintenance.
